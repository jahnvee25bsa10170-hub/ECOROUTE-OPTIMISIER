# Route Emissions Simulator - Project Statement

## Problem Statement
Current transportation planning often prioritizes time and cost efficiency without adequately considering environmental impact. There is a lack of accessible tools that allow users to quickly model and compare how different route characteristics (distance, speed, number of stops) affect carbon emissions. This makes it difficult for individuals and organizations to make informed decisions about environmentally conscious routing.

## Scope of the Project
This project develops a simulation tool that:
- Models multiple route variations between two geographic points
- Calculates estimated CO2 emissions based on distance, stops, and speed factors
- Provides comparative analysis and visualization of environmental impact
- Identifies optimal routes based on emission efficiency

The scope includes route generation, emissions calculation, results ranking, and basic visualization. It does not include real-time GPS integration, actual map data, or vehicle-specific emission profiles.

## Target Users
- **Environmental researchers** - for testing emission models and scenarios
- **Logistics planners** - to evaluate route efficiency and environmental impact
- **Urban planners** - to understand transportation emission patterns
- **Educators and students** - for learning about transportation environmental impact
- **Environmentally conscious commuters** - to understand routing choices

## High-level Features
- Random route generation with configurable parameters
- Customizable emission calculation model
- Route comparison and ranking by environmental impact
- Visualization of results through charts and graphs
- Export capabilities for analysis results
- Configurable simulation parameters for different scenarios
